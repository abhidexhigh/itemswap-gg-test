# RecentDecks Component Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to the RecentDecks component and its related files.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Component Memoization

- Used `React.memo()` for all components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Components optimized:
  - RecentDecksList
  - RecentDecksItems
  - RecentDecksCard
  - RecentDecksItem

### 2. Performance Improvements

- Implemented `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent recreation on each render
- Added `useMemo` for expensive calculations and data transformations
- Optimized state management to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Added conditional rendering to prevent errors with null/undefined data
- Improved image loading with priority flags for important images

### 3. Code Structure Improvements

- Removed unnecessary wrapper elements
- Simplified component structure
- Added proper null checks to prevent runtime errors
- Improved variable naming for better readability
- Added proper comments for better code maintainability

### 4. Image Optimization

- Added proper alt text for accessibility
- Added conditional rendering for images to prevent errors
- Used Next.js Image component properly for better performance

### 5. Event Handler Optimization

- Memoized event handlers with useCallback
- Simplified event handler logic
- Removed console.log statements

### 6. Rendering Optimization

- Used conditional rendering for deck details to improve performance
- Added proper key props to list items for better React reconciliation
- Extracted repeated calculations into memoized variables
